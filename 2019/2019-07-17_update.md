## CVE-2019-2771
 Vulnerability in the BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: BI Publisher Security). Supported versions that are affected are 11.1.1.9.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher). Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher), attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.2 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L).

## CVE-2019-2771
 Vulnerability in the BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: BI Publisher Security). Supported versions that are affected are 11.1.1.9.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher). Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher), attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher) accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of BI Publisher (formerly XML Publisher).
