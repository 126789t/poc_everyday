## CVE-2021-43557
 The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains "^/internal/", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.

## CVE-2021-40531
 Sketch before 75 allows library feeds to be used to bypass file quarantine. Files are automatically downloaded and opened, without the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute. This results in remote code execution, as demonstrated by CommandString in a terminal profile to Terminal.app.

## CVE-2021-43557
 The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains "^/internal/", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.

## CVE-2021-43557
 The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains "^/internal/", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.

## CVE-2021-40531
 Sketch before 75 allows library feeds to be used to bypass file quarantine. Files are automatically downloaded and opened, without the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute. This results in remote code execution, as demonstrated by CommandString in a terminal profile to Terminal.app.

## CVE-2021-43557
 The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains "^/internal/", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.

## CVE-2021-43557
 The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains "^/internal/", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.

## CVE-2021-40531
 Sketch before 75 allows library feeds to be used to bypass file quarantine. Files are automatically downloaded and opened, without the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute. This results in remote code execution, as demonstrated by CommandString in a terminal profile to Terminal.app.
