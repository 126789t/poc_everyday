## CVE-2019-1002101
 The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the users machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the users machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. The untar function can both create and follow symbolic links. The issue is resolved in kubectl v1.11.9, v1.12.7, v1.13.5, and v1.14.0.

## CVE-2018-4124
 An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. iOS before 11.2.6 is affected. macOS before 10.13.3 Supplemental Update is affected. tvOS before 11.2.6 is affected. watchOS before 4.2.3 is affected. The issue involves the "CoreText" component. It allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string containing a certain Telugu character.

## CVE-2019-1002101
 The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the users machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the users machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. The untar function can both create and follow symbolic links. The issue is resolved in kubectl v1.11.9, v1.12.7, v1.13.5, and v1.14.0.

## CVE-2018-4124
 An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. iOS before 11.2.6 is affected. macOS before 10.13.3 Supplemental Update is affected. tvOS before 11.2.6 is affected. watchOS before 4.2.3 is affected. The issue involves the "CoreText" component. It allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string containing a certain Telugu character.

## CVE-2019-1002101
 The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the users machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the users machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. The untar function can both create and follow symbolic links. The issue is resolved in kubectl v1.11.9, v1.12.7, v1.13.5, and v1.14.0.

## CVE-2018-4124
 An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. iOS before 11.2.6 is affected. macOS before 10.13.3 Supplemental Update is affected. tvOS before 11.2.6 is affected. watchOS before 4.2.3 is affected. The issue involves the "CoreText" component. It allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string containing a certain Telugu character.

## CVE-2019-1002101
 The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the users machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the users machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user.

## CVE-2019-1002101
 The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the users machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the users machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. The untar function can both create and follow symbolic links. The issue is resolved in kubectl v1.11.9, v1.12.7, v1.13.5, and v1.14.0.

## CVE-2018-4124
 An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. iOS before 11.2.6 is affected. macOS before 10.13.3 Supplemental Update is affected. tvOS before 11.2.6 is affected. watchOS before 4.2.3 is affected. The issue involves the "CoreText" component. It allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string containing a certain Telugu character.

It allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string containing a certain Telugu character.

## CVE-2019-1002101
 The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the users machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files to any path on the users machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the system permissions of the local user. The untar function can both create and follow symbolic links. The issue is resolved in kubectl v1.11.9, v1.12.7, v1.13.5, and v1.14.0.
