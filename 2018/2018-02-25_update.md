## CVE-2017-15303
 In CPUID CPU-Z before 1.43, there is an arbitrary memory write that results directly in elevation of privileges, because any program running on the local machine (while CPU-Z is running) can issue an ioctl 0x9C402430 call to the kernel-mode driver (e.g., cpuz141_x64.sys for version 1.41).

## CVE-2017-10352
 Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: WLS - Web Services). The supported version that is affected are 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.1.0, 12.2.1.2.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. While the vulnerability is in Oracle WebLogic Server, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle WebLogic Server as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.9 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H).

## CVE-2017-15303
 In CPUID CPU-Z before 1.43, there is an arbitrary memory write that results directly in elevation of privileges, because any program running on the local machine (while CPU-Z is running) can issue an ioctl 0x9C402430 call to the kernel-mode driver (e.g., cpuz141_x64.sys for version 1.41).

## CVE-2017-10352
 Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: WLS - Web Services). The supported version that is affected are 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.1.0, 12.2.1.2.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. While the vulnerability is in Oracle WebLogic Server, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle WebLogic Server as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.9 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H).

## CVE-2017-15303
 In CPUID CPU-Z before 1.43, there is an arbitrary memory write that results directly in elevation of privileges, because any program running on the local machine (while CPU-Z is running) can issue an ioctl 0x9C402430 call to the kernel-mode driver (e.g., cpuz141_x64.sys for version 1.41).

## CVE-2017-10352
 Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: WLS - Web Services). The supported version that is affected are 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, 12.2.1.1.0, 12.2.1.2.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. While the vulnerability is in Oracle WebLogic Server, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle WebLogic Server as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.9 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H).
