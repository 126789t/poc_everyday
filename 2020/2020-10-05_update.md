An attacker-controlled server can trigger an integer overflow in InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow and Remote Code Execution with SYSTEM privileges. This issue will occur only when untrusted communication is initiated with server. In cloud, Agent will always connect with trusted communication.

## CVE-2020-26061
 ClickStudios Passwordstate Password Reset Portal prior to build 8501 is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. The ResetPassword function does not validate whether the user has successfully authenticated using security questions. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the /account/ResetPassword page to set a new password for any registered user.

 A design issue was discovered in GetInternetRequestHandle, InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate in the client side of Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central 10.0.552.W and Remote Access Plus before 10.1.2119.1. By exploiting this issue, an attacker-controlled server can force the client to skip TLS certificate validation, leading to a man-in-the-middle attack against HTTPS and unauthenticated remote code execution.

## CVE-2020-15588
 An issue was discovered in the client side of Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central 10.0.552.W. An attacker-controlled server can trigger an integer overflow in InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow and Remote Code Execution with SYSTEM privileges. This issue will occur only when untrusted communication is initiated with server. In cloud, Agent will always connect with trusted communication.

## CVE-2020-26061
 ClickStudios Passwordstate Password Reset Portal prior to build 8501 is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. The ResetPassword function does not validate whether the user has successfully authenticated using security questions. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the /account/ResetPassword page to set a new password for any registered user.

## CVE-2020-15589
 A design issue was discovered in GetInternetRequestHandle, InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate in the client side of Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central 10.0.552.W and Remote Access Plus before 10.1.2119.1. By exploiting this issue, an attacker-controlled server can force the client to skip TLS certificate validation, leading to a man-in-the-middle attack against HTTPS and unauthenticated remote code execution.

## CVE-2020-26061
 ClickStudios Passwordstate Password Reset Portal prior to build 8501 is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. The ResetPassword function does not validate whether the user has successfully authenticated using security questions. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the /account/ResetPassword page to set a new password for any registered user.

## CVE-2020-15588
 An issue was discovered in the client side of Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central 10.0.552.W. An attacker-controlled server can trigger an integer overflow in InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow and Remote Code Execution with SYSTEM privileges. This issue will occur only when untrusted communication is initiated with server. In cloud, Agent will always connect with trusted communication.

## CVE-2020-26061
 ClickStudios Passwordstate Password Reset Portal prior to build 8501 is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. The ResetPassword function does not validate whether the user has successfully authenticated using security questions. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the /account/ResetPassword page to set a new password for any registered user.

## CVE-2020-15589
 A design issue was discovered in GetInternetRequestHandle, InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate in the client side of Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central 10.0.552.W and Remote Access Plus before 10.1.2119.1. By exploiting this issue, an attacker-controlled server can force the client to skip TLS certificate validation, leading to a man-in-the-middle attack against HTTPS and unauthenticated remote code execution.

## CVE-2020-15588
 An issue was discovered in the client side of Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central 10.0.552.W. An attacker-controlled server can trigger an integer overflow in InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow and Remote Code Execution with SYSTEM privileges. This issue will occur only when untrusted communication is initiated with server. In cloud, Agent will always connect with trusted communication.

## CVE-2020-26061
 ClickStudios Passwordstate Password Reset Portal prior to build 8501 is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. The ResetPassword function does not validate whether the user has successfully authenticated using security questions. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the /account/ResetPassword page to set a new password for any registered user.
