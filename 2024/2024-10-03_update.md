## CVE-2020-27199
 The Magic Home Pro application 1.5.1 for Android allows Authentication Bypass. The security control that the application currently has in place is a simple Username and Password authentication function. Using enumeration, an attacker is able to forge a User specific token without the need for correct password to gain access to the mobile application as that victim user.

## CVE-2020-27199
 The Magic Home Pro application 1.5.1 for Android allows Authentication Bypass. The security control that the application currently has in place is a simple Username and Password authentication function. Using enumeration, an attacker is able to forge a User specific token without the need for correct password to gain access to the mobile application as that victim user.

## CVE-2019-12836
 The Bobronix JEditor editor before 3.0.6 for Jira allows an attacker to add a URL/Link (to an existing issue) that can cause forgery of a request to an out-of-origin domain. This in turn may allow for a forged request that can be invoked in the context of an authenticated user, leading to stealing of session tokens and account takeover.

 The Bobronix JEditor editor before 3.0.6 for Jira allows an attacker to add a URL/Link (to an existing issue) that can cause forgery of a request to an out-of-origin domain. This in turn may allow for a forged request that can be invoked in the context of an authenticated user, leading to stealing of session tokens and account takeover.

## CVE-2020-27199
 The Magic Home Pro application 1.5.1 for Android allows Authentication Bypass. The security control that the application currently has in place is a simple Username and Password authentication function. Using enumeration, an attacker is able to forge a User specific token without the need for correct password to gain access to the mobile application as that victim user.

## CVE-2019-12836
 The Bobronix JEditor editor before 3.0.6 for Jira allows an attacker to add a URL/Link (to an existing issue) that can cause forgery of a request to an out-of-origin domain. This in turn may allow for a forged request that can be invoked in the context of an authenticated user, leading to stealing of session tokens and account takeover.

## CVE-2020-27199
 The Magic Home Pro application 1.5.1 for Android allows Authentication Bypass. The security control that the application currently has in place is a simple Username and Password authentication function. Using enumeration, an attacker is able to forge a User specific token without the need for correct password to gain access to the mobile application as that victim user.

## CVE-2019-12836
 The Bobronix JEditor editor before 3.0.6 for Jira allows an attacker to add a URL/Link (to an existing issue) that can cause forgery of a request to an out-of-origin domain. This in turn may allow for a forged request that can be invoked in the context of an authenticated user, leading to stealing of session tokens and account takeover.

## CVE-2020-27199
 The Magic Home Pro application 1.5.1 for Android allows Authentication Bypass. The security control that the application currently has in place is a simple Username and Password authentication function.

## CVE-2019-12836
 The Bobronix JEditor editor before 3.0.6 for Jira allows an attacker to add a URL/Link (to an existing issue) that can cause forgery of a request to an out-of-origin domain. This in turn may allow for a forged request that can be invoked in the context of an authenticated user, leading to stealing of session tokens and account takeover.

## CVE-2019-12836
 The Bobronix JEditor editor before 3.0.6 for Jira allows an attacker to add a URL/Link (to an existing issue) that can cause forgery of a request to an out-of-origin domain. This in turn may allow for a forged request that can be invoked in the context of an authenticated user, leading to stealing of session tokens and account takeover.

## CVE-2020-27199
 The Magic Home Pro application 1.5.1 for Android allows Authentication Bypass.
