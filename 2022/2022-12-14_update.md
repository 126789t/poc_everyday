## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2015-3145
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2015-3145
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2015-3145
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2015-3145
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2015-3145
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2015-3145
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2015-3145
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2015-3145
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.

## CVE-2020-5267
 In ActionView before versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2, there is a possible XSS vulnerability in ActionView's JavaScript literal escape helpers. Views that use the `j` or `escape_javascript` methods may be susceptible to XSS attacks. The issue is fixed in versions 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2020-5248
 GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key. Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again from the UI will work.

## CVE-2015-3145
 The sanitize_cookie_path function in cURL and libcurl 7.31.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a cookie path containing only a double-quote character.
