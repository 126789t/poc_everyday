## CVE-2019-6977
 gdImageColorMatch in gd_color_match.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka LibGD) 2.2.5, as used in the imagecolormatch function in PHP before 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1, has a heap-based buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker who is able to trigger imagecolormatch calls with crafted image data.

## CVE-2019-0211
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

## CVE-2019-0211
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

## CVE-2019-6977
 gdImageColorMatch in gd_color_match.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka LibGD) 2.2.5, as used in the imagecolormatch function in PHP before 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1, has a heap-based buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker who is able to trigger imagecolormatch calls with crafted image data.

## CVE-2019-2615
 Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: WLS Core Components). Supported versions that are affected are 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.9 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

## CVE-2019-0211
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

## CVE-2019-0211
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

## CVE-2019-6977
 gdImageColorMatch in gd_color_match.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka LibGD) 2.2.5, as used in the imagecolormatch function in PHP before 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1, has a heap-based buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker who is able to trigger imagecolormatch calls with crafted image data.

## CVE-2019-2615
 Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: WLS Core Components). Supported versions that are affected are 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.9 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

## CVE-2019-0211
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

## CVE-2019-0211
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

Non-Unix systems are not affected.

## CVE-2019-6977
 gdImageColorMatch in gd_color_match.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka LibGD) 2.2.5, as used in the imagecolormatch function in PHP before 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1, has a heap-based buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker who is able to trigger imagecolormatch calls with crafted image data.

## CVE-2019-0211
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

## CVE-2019-0211
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

## CVE-2019-6977
 gdImageColorMatch in gd_color_match.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka LibGD) 2.2.5, as used in the imagecolormatch function in PHP before 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1, has a heap-based buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker who is able to trigger imagecolormatch calls with crafted image data.

## CVE-2019-2615
 Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: WLS Core Components). Supported versions that are affected are 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.9 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).

## CVE-2019-0211
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.

## CVE-2019-6977
 gdImageColorMatch in gd_color_match.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka LibGD) 2.2.5, as used in the imagecolormatch function in PHP before 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1, has a heap-based buffer overflow. This can be exploited by an attacker who is able to trigger imagecolormatch calls with crafted image data.
