## CVE-2022-23862
 A Local Privilege Escalation issue was discovered in Y Soft SAFEQ 6 Build 53. The SafeQ JMX service running on port 9696 is vulnerable to JMX MLet attacks. Because the service did not enforce authentication and was running under the "NT Authority\System" user, an attacker is able to use the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code and elevate to the system user.

## CVE-2022-23862
 A Local Privilege Escalation issue was discovered in Y Soft SAFEQ 6 Build 53. The SafeQ JMX service running on port 9696 is vulnerable to JMX MLet attacks. Because the service did not enforce authentication and was running under the "NT Authority\System" user, an attacker is able to use the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code and elevate to the system user.

## CVE-2022-23862
 A Local Privilege Escalation issue was discovered in Y Soft SAFEQ 6 Build 53. The SafeQ JMX service running on port 9696 is vulnerable to JMX MLet attacks. Because the service did not enforce authentication and was running under the "NT Authority\System" user, an attacker is able to use the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code and elevate to the system user.

## CVE-2022-23861
 Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities were discovered in Y Soft SAFEQ 6 Build 53. Multiple fields in the YSoft SafeQ web application can be used to inject malicious inputs that, due to a lack of output sanitization, result in the execution of arbitrary JS code. These fields can be leveraged to perform XSS attacks on legitimate users accessing the SafeQ web interface.
