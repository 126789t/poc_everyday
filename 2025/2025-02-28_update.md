## CVE-2024-47051
 This advisory addresses two critical security vulnerabilities present in Mautic versions before 5.2.3. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by authenticated users.  *  Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Asset Upload:A Remote Code Execution vulnerability has been identified in the asset upload functionality. Insufficient enforcement of allowed file extensions allows an attacker to bypass restrictions and upload executable files, such as PHP scripts.  *  Path Traversal File Deletion:A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the upload validation process. Due to improper handling of path components, an authenticated user can manipulate the file deletion process to delete arbitrary files on the host system.

## CVE-2025-25967
 Acora CMS version 10.1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This flaw enables attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unauthorized actions, such as account deletion or user creation, by embedding malicious requests in external content. The lack of CSRF protections allows exploitation via crafted requests.

## CVE-2025-24971
 DumpDrop is a stupid simple file upload application that provides an interface for dragging and dropping files. An OS Command Injection vulnerability was discovered in the DumbDrop application, `/upload/init` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely when the **Apprise Notification** enabled. This issue has been addressed in commit `4ff8469d` and all users are advised to patch. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2025-22964
 DDSN Interactive cm3 Acora CMS version 10.1.1 has an unauthenticated time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability caused by insufficient input sanitization and validation in the "table" parameter. This flaw allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries by directly incorporating user-supplied input into database queries without proper escaping or validation. Exploiting this issue enables unauthorized access, manipulation of data, or exposure of sensitive information, posing significant risks to the integrity and confidentiality of the application.

 This advisory addresses two critical security vulnerabilities present in Mautic versions before 5.2.3. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by authenticated users.  *  Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Asset Upload:A Remote Code Execution vulnerability has been identified in the asset upload functionality. Insufficient enforcement of allowed file extensions allows an attacker to bypass restrictions and upload executable files, such as PHP scripts.  *  Path Traversal File Deletion:A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the upload validation process. Due to improper handling of path components, an authenticated user can manipulate the file deletion process to delete arbitrary files on the host system.

A critical security vulnerability exists in the `JonesFaithfulTransformation.from_transformation_str()` method within the `pymatgen` library prior to version 2024.2.20. This method insecurely utilizes `eval()` for processing input, enabling execution of arbitrary code when parsing untrusted input. Version 2024.2.20 fixes this issue.

## CVE-2025-25967
 Acora CMS version 10.1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This flaw enables attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unauthorized actions, such as account deletion or user creation, by embedding malicious requests in external content. The lack of CSRF protections allows exploitation via crafted requests.

## CVE-2025-24971
 DumpDrop is a stupid simple file upload application that provides an interface for dragging and dropping files. An OS Command Injection vulnerability was discovered in the DumbDrop application, `/upload/init` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely when the **Apprise Notification** enabled. This issue has been addressed in commit `4ff8469d` and all users are advised to patch. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2025-22964
 DDSN Interactive cm3 Acora CMS version 10.1.1 has an unauthenticated time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability caused by insufficient input sanitization and validation in the "table" parameter. This flaw allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries by directly incorporating user-supplied input into database queries without proper escaping or validation. Exploiting this issue enables unauthorized access, manipulation of data, or exposure of sensitive information, posing significant risks to the integrity and confidentiality of the application.

 This advisory addresses two critical security vulnerabilities present in Mautic versions before 5.2.3. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by authenticated users.  *  Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Asset Upload:A Remote Code Execution vulnerability has been identified in the asset upload functionality. Insufficient enforcement of allowed file extensions allows an attacker to bypass restrictions and upload executable files, such as PHP scripts.  *  Path Traversal File Deletion:A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the upload validation process. Due to improper handling of path components, an authenticated user can manipulate the file deletion process to delete arbitrary files on the host system.

## CVE-2024-23346
 Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) is an open-source Python library for materials analysis. A critical security vulnerability exists in the `JonesFaithfulTransformation.from_transformation_str()` method within the `pymatgen` library prior to version 2024.2.20. This method insecurely utilizes `eval()` for processing input, enabling execution of arbitrary code when parsing untrusted input. Version 2024.2.20 fixes this issue.

## CVE-2025-24971
 DumpDrop is a stupid simple file upload application that provides an interface for dragging and dropping files. An OS Command Injection vulnerability was discovered in the DumbDrop application, `/upload/init` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely when the **Apprise Notification** enabled. This issue has been addressed in commit `4ff8469d` and all users are advised to patch. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2025-22964
 DDSN Interactive cm3 Acora CMS version 10.1.1 has an unauthenticated time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability caused by insufficient input sanitization and validation in the "table" parameter. This flaw allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries by directly incorporating user-supplied input into database queries without proper escaping or validation. Exploiting this issue enables unauthorized access, manipulation of data, or exposure of sensitive information, posing significant risks to the integrity and confidentiality of the application.

 This advisory addresses two critical security vulnerabilities present in Mautic versions before 5.2.3. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by authenticated users.  *  Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Asset Upload:A Remote Code Execution vulnerability has been identified in the asset upload functionality. Insufficient enforcement of allowed file extensions allows an attacker to bypass restrictions and upload executable files, such as PHP scripts.  *  Path Traversal File Deletion:A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the upload validation process. Due to improper handling of path components, an authenticated user can manipulate the file deletion process to delete arbitrary files on the host system.

Insufficient enforcement of allowed file extensions allows an attacker to bypass restrictions and upload executable files, such as PHP scripts.  *  Path Traversal File Deletion:A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the upload validation process. Due to improper handling of path components, an authenticated user can manipulate the file deletion process to delete arbitrary files on the host system.

## CVE-2025-22964
 DDSN Interactive cm3 Acora CMS version 10.1.1 has an unauthenticated time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability caused by insufficient input sanitization and validation in the "table" parameter. This flaw allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries by directly incorporating user-supplied input into database queries without proper escaping or validation. Exploiting this issue enables unauthorized access, manipulation of data, or exposure of sensitive information, posing significant risks to the integrity and confidentiality of the application.
