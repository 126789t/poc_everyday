## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.

 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-22894
 Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel) to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g., Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive information for all API users but not other admin accounts.

## CVE-2023-0464
 A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versionsof OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chainsthat include policy constraints.  Attackers may be able to exploit thisvulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggersexponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service(DoS) attack on affected systems.Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passingthe `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

## CVE-2022-4304
 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementationwhich could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in aBleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attackerwould have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages fordecryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send anencrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed agenuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to sendtrial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After asufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-mastersecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt theapplication data sent over that connection.
