## CVE-2019-20059
 payment_manage.ajax.php and various *_manage.ajax.php in MFScripts YetiShare 3.5.2 through 4.5.4 directly insert values from the sSortDir_0 parameter into a SQL string. This allows an attacker to inject their own SQL and manipulate the query, typically extracting data from the database, aka SQL Injection. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-19732.

## CVE-2019-12180
 An issue was discovered in SmartBear ReadyAPI through 2.8.2 and 3.0.0 and SoapUI through 5.5. When opening a project, the Groovy "Load Script" is automatically executed. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Groovy Language code (Java scripting language) on the victim machine by inducing it to open a malicious Project. The same issue is present in the "Save Script" function, which is executed automatically when saving a project.

## CVE-2019-20059
 payment_manage.ajax.php and various *_manage.ajax.php in MFScripts YetiShare 3.5.2 through 4.5.4 directly insert values from the sSortDir_0 parameter into a SQL string. This allows an attacker to inject their own SQL and manipulate the query, typically extracting data from the database, aka SQL Injection. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-19732.

## CVE-2019-12180
 An issue was discovered in SmartBear ReadyAPI through 2.8.2 and 3.0.0 and SoapUI through 5.5. When opening a project, the Groovy "Load Script" is automatically executed. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Groovy Language code (Java scripting language) on the victim machine by inducing it to open a malicious Project. The same issue is present in the "Save Script" function, which is executed automatically when saving a project.

## CVE-2019-20059
 payment_manage.ajax.php and various *_manage.ajax.php in MFScripts YetiShare 3.5.2 through 4.5.4 directly insert values from the sSortDir_0 parameter into a SQL string. This allows an attacker to inject their own SQL and manipulate the query, typically extracting data from the database, aka SQL Injection. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-19732.

## CVE-2019-20059
 payment_manage.ajax.php and various *_manage.ajax.php in MFScripts YetiShare 3.5.2 through 4.5.4 directly insert values from the sSortDir_0 parameter into a SQL string. This allows an attacker to inject their own SQL and manipulate the query, typically extracting data from the database, aka SQL Injection. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-19732.

## CVE-2019-12180
 An issue was discovered in SmartBear ReadyAPI through 2.8.2 and 3.0.0 and SoapUI through 5.5. When opening a project, the Groovy "Load Script" is automatically executed. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Groovy Language code (Java scripting language) on the victim machine by inducing it to open a malicious Project. The same issue is present in the "Save Script" function, which is executed automatically when saving a project.

## CVE-2019-12180
 An issue was discovered in SmartBear ReadyAPI through 2.8.2 and 3.0.0 and SoapUI through 5.5. When opening a project, the Groovy "Load Script" is automatically executed. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Groovy Language code (Java scripting language) on the victim machine by inducing it to open a malicious Project. The same issue is present in the "Save Script" function, which is executed automatically when saving a project.

## CVE-2019-20059
 payment_manage.ajax.php and various *_manage.ajax.php in MFScripts YetiShare 3.5.2 through 4.5.4 directly insert values from the sSortDir_0 parameter into a SQL string. This allows an attacker to inject their own SQL and manipulate the query, typically extracting data from the database, aka SQL Injection. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-19732.

## CVE-2019-20059
 payment_manage.ajax.php and various *_manage.ajax.php in MFScripts YetiShare 3.5.2 through 4.5.4 directly insert values from the sSortDir_0 parameter into a SQL string. This allows an attacker to inject their own SQL and manipulate the query, typically extracting data from the database, aka SQL Injection. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-19732.

## CVE-2019-12180
 An issue was discovered in SmartBear ReadyAPI through 2.8.2 and 3.0.0 and SoapUI through 5.5. When opening a project, the Groovy "Load Script" is automatically executed. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Groovy Language code (Java scripting language) on the victim machine by inducing it to open a malicious Project. The same issue is present in the "Save Script" function, which is executed automatically when saving a project.

## CVE-2019-12180
 An issue was discovered in SmartBear ReadyAPI through 2.8.2 and 3.0.0 and SoapUI through 5.5. When opening a project, the Groovy "Load Script" is automatically executed. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Groovy Language code (Java scripting language) on the victim machine by inducing it to open a malicious Project. The same issue is present in the "Save Script" function, which is executed automatically when saving a project.

## CVE-2019-20059
 payment_manage.ajax.php and various *_manage.ajax.php in MFScripts YetiShare 3.5.2 through 4.5.4 directly insert values from the sSortDir_0 parameter into a SQL string. This allows an attacker to inject their own SQL and manipulate the query, typically extracting data from the database, aka SQL Injection. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-19732.
