## CVE-2023-27328
 Parallels Desktop Toolgate XML Injection Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the Toolgate component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct an XML document. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-19187.

## CVE-2023-0461
 There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLSor CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCPhas to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_dataof a struct inet_connection_sock.When CONFIG_TLSis enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.The setsockoptTCP_ULPoperation does not require any privilege.We recommend upgrading past commit2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c

## CVE-2023-27328
 Parallels Desktop Toolgate XML Injection Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the Toolgate component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct an XML document. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-19187.

## CVE-2023-0461
 There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLSor CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCPhas to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_dataof a struct inet_connection_sock.When CONFIG_TLSis enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.The setsockoptTCP_ULPoperation does not require any privilege.We recommend upgrading past commit2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c

## CVE-2023-27328
 Parallels Desktop Toolgate XML Injection Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the Toolgate component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct an XML document. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-19187.

## CVE-2023-0461
 There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLSor CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCPhas to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_dataof a struct inet_connection_sock.When CONFIG_TLSis enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.The setsockoptTCP_ULPoperation does not require any privilege.We recommend upgrading past commit2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c

## CVE-2023-27328
 Parallels Desktop Toolgate XML Injection Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the Toolgate component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct an XML document. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-19187.

## CVE-2023-0461
 There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLSor CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCPhas to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_dataof a struct inet_connection_sock.When CONFIG_TLSis enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.The setsockoptTCP_ULPoperation does not require any privilege.We recommend upgrading past commit2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c

## CVE-2023-27328
 Parallels Desktop Toolgate XML Injection Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the Toolgate component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct an XML document. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-19187.

## CVE-2023-0461
 There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLSor CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCPhas to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_dataof a struct inet_connection_sock.When CONFIG_TLSis enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.The setsockoptTCP_ULPoperation does not require any privilege.We recommend upgrading past commit2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c
