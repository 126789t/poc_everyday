## CVE-2016-8863
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the create_url_list function in gena/gena_device.c in Portable UPnP SDK (aka libupnp) before 1.6.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a valid URI followed by an invalid one in the CALLBACK header of an SUBSCRIBE request.

## CVE-2020-9470
 An issue was discovered in Wing FTP Server 6.2.5 before February 2020. Due to insecure permissions when handling session cookies, a local user may view the contents of the session and session_admin directories, which expose active session cookies within the Wing FTP HTTP interface and administration panel. These cookies may be used to hijack user and administrative sessions, including the ability to execute Lua commands as root within the administration panel.
