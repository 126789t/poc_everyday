## CVE-2022-37705
 A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary (it expects that the argument name and value are separated with a space; however, separating them with an equals sign is also supported),

## CVE-2022-37704
 Amanda 3.5.1 allows privilege escalation from the regular user backup to root. The SUID binary located at /lib/amanda/rundump will execute /usr/sbin/dump as root with controlled arguments from the attacker which may lead to escalation of privileges, denial of service, and information disclosure.

## CVE-2022-37705
 A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary (it expects that the argument name and value are separated with a space; however, separating them with an equals sign is also supported),

## CVE-2022-37705
 A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary (it expects that the argument name and value are separated with a space; however, separating them with an equals sign is also supported),

## CVE-2022-37705
 A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary (it expects that the argument name and value are separated with a space; however, separating them with an equals sign is also supported),

## CVE-2022-37704
 Amanda 3.5.1 allows privilege escalation from the regular user backup to root. The SUID binary located at /lib/amanda/rundump will execute /usr/sbin/dump as root with controlled arguments from the attacker which may lead to escalation of privileges, denial of service, and information disclosure.

## CVE-2022-37704
 Amanda 3.5.1 allows privilege escalation from the regular user backup to root. The SUID binary located at /lib/amanda/rundump will execute /usr/sbin/dump as root with controlled arguments from the attacker which may lead to escalation of privileges, denial of service, and information disclosure.

## CVE-2020-11520
 The SDDisk2k.sys driver of WinMagic SecureDoc v8.5 and earlier allows local users to write to arbitrary kernel memory addresses because the IOCTL dispatcher lacks pointer validation. Exploiting this vulnerability results in privileged code execution.

## CVE-2022-37705
 A privilege escalation flaw was found in Amanda 3.5.1 in which the backup user can acquire root privileges. The vulnerable component is the runtar SUID program, which is a wrapper to run /usr/bin/tar with specific arguments that are controllable by the attacker. This program mishandles the arguments passed to tar binary (it expects that the argument name and value are separated with a space; however, separating them with an equals sign is also supported),
