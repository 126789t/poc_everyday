## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.

## CVE-2022-39802
 SAP Manufacturing Execution - versions 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, allows an attacker to exploit insufficient validation of a file path request parameter. The intended file path can be manipulated to allow arbitrary traversal of directories on the remote server. The file content within each directory can be read which may lead to information disclosure.

## CVE-2021-4410
 The Qtranslate Slug plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.18. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_postdata() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save post data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## CVE-2017-1000253
 Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm-mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm-mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm-mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the "gap" between the stack and the binary.
