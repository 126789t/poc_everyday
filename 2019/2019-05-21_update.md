## CVE-2019-1821
 A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute code with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability exist because the software improperly validates user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file to the administrative web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system.
