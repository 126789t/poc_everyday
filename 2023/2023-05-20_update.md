## CVE-2023-31634
 In TeslaMate before 1.27.2, there is unauthorized access to port 4000 for remote viewing and operation of user data. After accessing the IP address for the TeslaMate instance, an attacker can switch the port to 3000 to enter Grafana for remote operations. At that time, the default username and password can be used to enter the Grafana management console without logging in, a related issue to CVE-2022-23126.

## CVE-2022-4931
 The BackupWordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in versions up to, and including 3.12. This is due to missing authorization on the heartbeat_received() function that triggers on WordPress heartbeat. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above to retrieve back-up paths that can subsequently be used to download the back-up.

## CVE-2022-4931
 The BackupWordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in versions up to, and including 3.12. This is due to missing authorization on the heartbeat_received() function that triggers on WordPress heartbeat. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above to retrieve back-up paths that can subsequently be used to download the back-up.

## CVE-2023-31634
 In TeslaMate before 1.27.2, there is unauthorized access to port 4000 for remote viewing and operation of user data. After accessing the IP address for the TeslaMate instance, an attacker can switch the port to 3000 to enter Grafana for remote operations. At that time, the default username and password can be used to enter the Grafana management console without logging in, a related issue to CVE-2022-23126.

## CVE-2022-4931
 The BackupWordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in versions up to, and including 3.12. This is due to missing authorization on the heartbeat_received() function that triggers on WordPress heartbeat. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above to retrieve back-up paths that can subsequently be used to download the back-up.
