## CVE-2022-22968
 In Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 - 5.3.18, 5.2.0 - 5.2.20, and older unsupported versions, the patterns for disallowedFields on a DataBinder are case sensitive which means a field is not effectively protected unless it is listed with both upper and lower case for the first character of the field, including upper and lower case for the first character of all nested fields within the property path.

## CVE-2022-0918
 A vulnerability was discovered in the 389 Directory Server that allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the LDAP port to cause a denial of service. The denial of service is triggered by a single message sent over a TCP connection, no bind or other authentication is required. The message triggers a segmentation fault that results in slapd crashing.

## CVE-2021-3929
 A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.

The message triggers a segmentation fault that results in slapd crashing.

## CVE-2021-3929
 A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.

## CVE-2022-22968
 In Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 - 5.3.18, 5.2.0 - 5.2.20, and older unsupported versions, the patterns for disallowedFields on a DataBinder are case sensitive which means a field is not effectively protected unless it is listed with both upper and lower case for the first character of the field, including upper and lower case for the first character of all nested fields within the property path.

## CVE-2022-0918
 A vulnerability was discovered in the 389 Directory Server that allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the LDAP port to cause a denial of service. The denial of service is triggered by a single message sent over a TCP connection, no bind or other authentication is required. The message triggers a segmentation fault that results in slapd crashing.

## CVE-2021-3929
 A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.

## CVE-2022-0918
 A vulnerability was discovered in the 389 Directory Server that allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the LDAP port to cause a denial of service. The denial of service is triggered by a single message sent over a TCP connection, no bind or other authentication is required. The message triggers a segmentation fault that results in slapd crashing.

## CVE-2021-3929
 A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.

The denial of service is triggered by a single message sent over a TCP connection, no bind or other authentication is required. The message triggers a segmentation fault that results in slapd crashing.

## CVE-2021-3929
 A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.

## CVE-2022-22968
 In Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 - 5.3.18, 5.2.0 - 5.2.20, and older unsupported versions, the patterns for disallowedFields on a DataBinder are case sensitive which means a field is not effectively protected unless it is listed with both upper and lower case for the first character of the field, including upper and lower case for the first character of all nested fields within the property path.

## CVE-2022-0918
 A vulnerability was discovered in the 389 Directory Server that allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the LDAP port to cause a denial of service. The denial of service is triggered by a single message sent over a TCP connection, no bind or other authentication is required. The message triggers a segmentation fault that results in slapd crashing.

## CVE-2021-3929
 A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.

## CVE-2022-0918
 A vulnerability was discovered in the 389 Directory Server that allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the LDAP port to cause a denial of service. The denial of service is triggered by a single message sent over a TCP connection, no bind or other authentication is required. The message triggers a segmentation fault that results in slapd crashing.

## CVE-2021-3929
 A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.
