## CVE-2020-7934
 In LifeRay Portal CE 7.1.0 through 7.2.1 GA2, the First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name fields for user accounts in MyAccountPortlet are all vulnerable to a persistent XSS issue. Any user can modify these fields with a particular XSS payload, and it will be stored in the database. The payload will then be rendered when a user utilizes the search feature to search for other users (i.e., if a user with modified fields occurs in the search results). This issue was fixed in Liferay Portal CE version 7.3.0 GA1.

## CVE-2017-0505
 An elevation of privilege vulnerability in MediaTek components, including the M4U driver, sound driver, touchscreen driver, GPU driver, and Command Queue driver, could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as Critical due to the possibility of a local permanent device compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device. Product: Android. Versions: N/A. Android ID: A-31822282. References: M-ALPS02992041.

## CVE-2017-0505
 An elevation of privilege vulnerability in MediaTek components, including the M4U driver, sound driver, touchscreen driver, GPU driver, and Command Queue driver, could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as Critical due to the possibility of a local permanent device compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device. Product: Android. Versions: N/A. Android ID: A-31822282. References: M-ALPS02992041.

## CVE-2020-7934
 In LifeRay Portal CE 7.1.0 through 7.2.1 GA2, the First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name fields for user accounts in MyAccountPortlet are all vulnerable to a persistent XSS issue. Any user can modify these fields with a particular XSS payload, and it will be stored in the database. The payload will then be rendered when a user utilizes the search feature to search for other users (i.e., if a user with modified fields occurs in the search results). This issue was fixed in Liferay Portal CE version 7.3.0 GA1.
