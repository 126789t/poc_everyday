## CVE-2021-41073
 loop_rw_iter in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel 5.10 through 5.14.6 allows local users to gain privileges by using IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS to trigger a free of a kernel buffer, as demonstrated by using /proc/pid/maps for exploitation.

## CVE-2021-20233
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Setparam_prefix() in the menu rendering code performs a length calculation on the assumption that expressing a quoted single quote will require 3 characters, while it actually requires 4 characters which allows an attacker to corrupt memory by one byte for each quote in the input. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

## CVE-2020-25632
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

## CVE-2019-8985
 On Netis WF2411 with firmware 2.1.36123 and other Netis WF2xxx devices (possibly WF2411 through WF2880), there is a stack-based buffer overflow that does not require authentication. This can cause denial of service (device restart) or remote code execution. This vulnerability can be triggered by a GET request with a long HTTP "Authorization: Basic" header that is mishandled by user_auth-user_ok in /bin/boa.

## CVE-2021-41073
 loop_rw_iter in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel 5.10 through 5.14.6 allows local users to gain privileges by using IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS to trigger a free of a kernel buffer, as demonstrated by using /proc/pid/maps for exploitation.

## CVE-2021-20233
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Setparam_prefix() in the menu rendering code performs a length calculation on the assumption that expressing a quoted single quote will require 3 characters, while it actually requires 4 characters which allows an attacker to corrupt memory by one byte for each quote in the input. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

## CVE-2020-25632
 A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

## CVE-2019-8985
 On Netis WF2411 with firmware 2.1.36123 and other Netis WF2xxx devices (possibly WF2411 through WF2880), there is a stack-based buffer overflow that does not require authentication. This can cause denial of service (device restart) or remote code execution. This vulnerability can be triggered by a GET request with a long HTTP "Authorization: Basic" header that is mishandled by user_auth-user_ok in /bin/boa.
