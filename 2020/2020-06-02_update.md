## CVE-2020-12078
 An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.

## CVE-2019-7616
 Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.

## CVE-2019-7616
 Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.

## CVE-2020-12078
 An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.

## CVE-2019-7616
 Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.

## CVE-2020-12078
 An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.

## CVE-2019-7616
 Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.

## CVE-2020-12078
 An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.

## CVE-2019-7616
 Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.

## CVE-2020-12078
 An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.

## CVE-2019-7616
 Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.

## CVE-2020-12078
 An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.

## CVE-2019-7616
 Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.

## CVE-2020-12078
 An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.

## CVE-2019-7616
 Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.

## CVE-2020-12078
 An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.

 Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.

## CVE-2020-12078
 An issue was discovered in Open-AudIT 3.3.1. There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.
