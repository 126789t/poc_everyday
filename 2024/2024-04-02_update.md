## CVE-2024-25723
 ZenML Server in the ZenML machine learning package before 0.46.7 for Python allows remote privilege escalation because the /api/v1/users/{user_name_or_id}/activate REST API endpoint allows access on the basis of a valid username along with a new password in the request body. These are also patched versions: 0.44.4, 0.43.1, and 0.42.2.

## CVE-2023-32314
 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

 ZenML Server in the ZenML machine learning package before 0.46.7 for Python allows remote privilege escalation because the /api/v1/users/{user_name_or_id}/activate REST API endpoint allows access on the basis of a valid username along with a new password in the request body. These are also patched versions: 0.44.4, 0.43.1, and 0.42.2.

## CVE-2023-32314
 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2023-48022
 Anyscale Ray 2.6.3 and 2.8.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the job submission API. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this report is irrelevant because Ray, as stated in its documentation, is not intended for use outside of a strictly controlled network environment

## CVE-2023-32314
 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2024-25723
 ZenML Server in the ZenML machine learning package before 0.46.7 for Python allows remote privilege escalation because the /api/v1/users/{user_name_or_id}/activate REST API endpoint allows access on the basis of a valid username along with a new password in the request body. These are also patched versions: 0.44.4, 0.43.1, and 0.42.2.

## CVE-2023-32314
 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2023-32314
 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2024-25723
 ZenML Server in the ZenML machine learning package before 0.46.7 for Python allows remote privilege escalation because the /api/v1/users/{user_name_or_id}/activate REST API endpoint allows access on the basis of a valid username along with a new password in the request body. These are also patched versions: 0.44.4, 0.43.1, and 0.42.2.

## CVE-2023-32314
 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2023-32314
 vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2024-25723
 ZenML Server in the ZenML machine learning package before 0.46.7 for Python allows remote privilege escalation because the /api/v1/users/{user_name_or_id}/activate REST API endpoint allows access on the basis of a valid username along with a new password in the request body. These are also patched versions: 0.44.4, 0.43.1, and 0.42.2.

## CVE-2023-48022
 Anyscale Ray 2.6.3 and 2.8.0 allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via the job submission API. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this report is irrelevant because Ray, as stated in its documentation, is not intended for use outside of a strictly controlled network environment
