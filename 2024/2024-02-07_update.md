## CVE-2018-17924
 Rockwell Automation MicroLogix 1400 Controllers and 1756 ControlLogix Communications Modules An unauthenticated, remote threat actor could send a CIP connection request to an affected device, and upon successful connection, send a new IP configuration to the affected device even if the controller in the system is set to Hard RUN mode. When the affected device accepts this new IP configuration, a loss of communication occurs between the device and the rest of the system as the system traffic is still attempting to communicate with the device via the overwritten IP address.
