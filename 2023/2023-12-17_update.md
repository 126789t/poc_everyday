## CVE-2022-29063
 The Solr plugin of Apache OFBiz is configured by default to automatically make a RMI request on localhost, port 1099. In version 18.12.05 and earlier, by hosting a malicious RMI server on localhost, an attacker may exploit this behavior, at server start-up or on a server restart, in order to run arbitrary code. Upgrade to at least 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12646.

## CVE-2022-25813
 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

 Spring Framework 3.0.0 through 3.0.5, Spring Security 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 and 2.0.0 through 2.0.6, and possibly other versions deserialize objects from untrusted sources, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended security restrictions and execute untrusted code by (1) serializing a java.lang.Proxy instance and using InvocationHandler, or (2) accessing internal AOP interfaces, as demonstrated using deserialization of a DefaultListableBeanFactory instance to execute arbitrary commands via the java.lang.Runtime class.

 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

## CVE-2022-29063
 The Solr plugin of Apache OFBiz is configured by default to automatically make a RMI request on localhost, port 1099. In version 18.12.05 and earlier, by hosting a malicious RMI server on localhost, an attacker may exploit this behavior, at server start-up or on a server restart, in order to run arbitrary code. Upgrade to at least 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12646.

## CVE-2022-25813
 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

In version 18.12.05 and earlier, by hosting a malicious RMI server on localhost, an attacker may exploit this behavior, at server start-up or on a server restart, in order to run arbitrary code. Upgrade to at least 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12646.

## CVE-2022-25813
 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

 Spring Framework 3.0.0 through 3.0.5, Spring Security 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 and 2.0.0 through 2.0.6, and possibly other versions deserialize objects from untrusted sources, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended security restrictions and execute untrusted code by (1) serializing a java.lang.Proxy instance and using InvocationHandler, or (2) accessing internal AOP interfaces, as demonstrated using deserialization of a DefaultListableBeanFactory instance to execute arbitrary commands via the java.lang.Runtime class.

 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

## CVE-2022-29063
 The Solr plugin of Apache OFBiz is configured by default to automatically make a RMI request on localhost, port 1099. In version 18.12.05 and earlier, by hosting a malicious RMI server on localhost, an attacker may exploit this behavior, at server start-up or on a server restart, in order to run arbitrary code. Upgrade to at least 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12646.

## CVE-2022-25813
 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

In version 18.12.05 and earlier, by hosting a malicious RMI server on localhost, an attacker may exploit this behavior, at server start-up or on a server restart, in order to run arbitrary code. Upgrade to at least 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12646.

## CVE-2022-25813
 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

 Spring Framework 3.0.0 through 3.0.5, Spring Security 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 and 2.0.0 through 2.0.6, and possibly other versions deserialize objects from untrusted sources, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended security restrictions and execute untrusted code by (1) serializing a java.lang.Proxy instance and using InvocationHandler, or (2) accessing internal AOP interfaces, as demonstrated using deserialization of a DefaultListableBeanFactory instance to execute arbitrary commands via the java.lang.Runtime class.

 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

## CVE-2022-29063
 The Solr plugin of Apache OFBiz is configured by default to automatically make a RMI request on localhost, port 1099. In version 18.12.05 and earlier, by hosting a malicious RMI server on localhost, an attacker may exploit this behavior, at server start-up or on a server restart, in order to run arbitrary code. Upgrade to at least 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12646.

## CVE-2022-25813
 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

In version 18.12.05 and earlier, by hosting a malicious RMI server on localhost, an attacker may exploit this behavior, at server start-up or on a server restart, in order to run arbitrary code. Upgrade to at least 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12646.

## CVE-2022-25813
 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

 Spring Framework 3.0.0 through 3.0.5, Spring Security 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 and 2.0.0 through 2.0.6, and possibly other versions deserialize objects from untrusted sources, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended security restrictions and execute untrusted code by (1) serializing a java.lang.Proxy instance and using InvocationHandler, or (2) accessing internal AOP interfaces, as demonstrated using deserialization of a DefaultListableBeanFactory instance to execute arbitrary commands via the java.lang.Runtime class.

 In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message Subject field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.

## CVE-2011-2894
 Spring Framework 3.0.0 through 3.0.5, Spring Security 3.0.0 through 3.0.5 and 2.0.0 through 2.0.6, and possibly other versions deserialize objects from untrusted sources, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended security restrictions and execute untrusted code by (1) serializing a java.lang.Proxy instance and using InvocationHandler, or (2) accessing internal AOP interfaces, as demonstrated using deserialization of a DefaultListableBeanFactory instance to execute arbitrary commands via the java.lang.Runtime class.

## CVE-2022-29063
 The Solr plugin of Apache OFBiz is configured by default to automatically make a RMI request on localhost, port 1099. In version 18.12.05 and earlier, by hosting a malicious RMI server on localhost, an attacker may exploit this behavior, at server start-up or on a server restart, in order to run arbitrary code. Upgrade to at least 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12646.
