## CVE-2020-8617
 Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.

## CVE-2019-8656
 This was addressed with additional checks by Gatekeeper on files mounted through a network share. This issue is fixed in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, Security Update 2019-004 High Sierra, Security Update 2019-004 Sierra. Extracting a zip file containing a symbolic link to an endpoint in an NFS mount that is attacker controlled may bypass Gatekeeper.

## CVE-2019-8656
 This was addressed with additional checks by Gatekeeper on files mounted through a network share. This issue is fixed in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, Security Update 2019-004 High Sierra, Security Update 2019-004 Sierra. Extracting a zip file containing a symbolic link to an endpoint in an NFS mount that is attacker controlled may bypass Gatekeeper.

## CVE-2020-8617
 Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.

## CVE-2019-8656
 This was addressed with additional checks by Gatekeeper on files mounted through a network share. This issue is fixed in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, Security Update 2019-004 High Sierra, Security Update 2019-004 Sierra. Extracting a zip file containing a symbolic link to an endpoint in an NFS mount that is attacker controlled may bypass Gatekeeper.

## CVE-2020-8617
 Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.

This issue is fixed in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, Security Update 2019-004 High Sierra, Security Update 2019-004 Sierra. Extracting a zip file containing a symbolic link to an endpoint in an NFS mount that is attacker controlled may bypass Gatekeeper.

## CVE-2020-8617
 Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.

## CVE-2020-8617
 Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.

## CVE-2019-8656
 This was addressed with additional checks by Gatekeeper on files mounted through a network share. This issue is fixed in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, Security Update 2019-004 High Sierra, Security Update 2019-004 Sierra. Extracting a zip file containing a symbolic link to an endpoint in an NFS mount that is attacker controlled may bypass Gatekeeper.

## CVE-2019-8656
 This was addressed with additional checks by Gatekeeper on files mounted through a network share. This issue is fixed in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, Security Update 2019-004 High Sierra, Security Update 2019-004 Sierra. Extracting a zip file containing a symbolic link to an endpoint in an NFS mount that is attacker controlled may bypass Gatekeeper.

## CVE-2020-8617
 Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server.

In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits.

## CVE-2019-8656
 This was addressed with additional checks by Gatekeeper on files mounted through a network share. This issue is fixed in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, Security Update 2019-004 High Sierra, Security Update 2019-004 Sierra. Extracting a zip file containing a symbolic link to an endpoint in an NFS mount that is attacker controlled may bypass Gatekeeper.

## CVE-2020-8617
 Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.
