## CVE-2024-36079
 An issue was discovered in Vaultize 21.07.27. When uploading files, there is no check that the filename parameter is correct. As a result, a temporary file will be created outside the specified directory when the file is downloaded. To exploit this, an authenticated user would upload a file with an incorrect file name, and then download it.

## CVE-2024-36079
 An issue was discovered in Vaultize 21.07.27. When uploading files, there is no check that the filename parameter is correct. As a result, a temporary file will be created outside the specified directory when the file is downloaded. To exploit this, an authenticated user would upload a file with an incorrect file name, and then download it.
