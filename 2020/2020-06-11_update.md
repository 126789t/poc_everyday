## CVE-2020-10749
 A vulnerability was found in all versions of containernetworking/plugins before version 0.8.6, that allows malicious containers in Kubernetes clusters to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A malicious container can exploit this flaw by sending rogue IPv6 router advertisements to the host or other containers, to redirect traffic to the malicious container.

## CVE-2020-6096
 An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

## CVE-2020-10749
 A vulnerability was found in all versions of containernetworking/plugins before version 0.8.6, that allows malicious containers in Kubernetes clusters to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A malicious container can exploit this flaw by sending rogue IPv6 router advertisements to the host or other containers, to redirect traffic to the malicious container.

## CVE-2020-6096
 An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

## CVE-2020-10749
 A vulnerability was found in all versions of containernetworking/plugins before version 0.8.6, that allows malicious containers in Kubernetes clusters to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A malicious container can exploit this flaw by sending rogue IPv6 router advertisements to the host or other containers, to redirect traffic to the malicious container.

## CVE-2020-6096
 An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

## CVE-2020-6096
 An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

## CVE-2020-10749
 A vulnerability was found in all versions of containernetworking/plugins before version 0.8.6, that allows malicious containers in Kubernetes clusters to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A malicious container can exploit this flaw by sending rogue IPv6 router advertisements to the host or other containers, to redirect traffic to the malicious container.

## CVE-2020-6096
 An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

## CVE-2020-10749
 A vulnerability was found in all versions of containernetworking/plugins before version 0.8.6, that allows malicious containers in Kubernetes clusters to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A malicious container can exploit this flaw by sending rogue IPv6 router advertisements to the host or other containers, to redirect traffic to the malicious container.

## CVE-2020-6096
 An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

## CVE-2020-10749
 A vulnerability was found in all versions of containernetworking/plugins before version 0.8.6, that allows malicious containers in Kubernetes clusters to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A malicious container can exploit this flaw by sending rogue IPv6 router advertisements to the host or other containers, to redirect traffic to the malicious container.

## CVE-2020-6096
 An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

## CVE-2020-10749
 A vulnerability was found in all versions of containernetworking/plugins before version 0.8.6, that allows malicious containers in Kubernetes clusters to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A malicious container can exploit this flaw by sending rogue IPv6 router advertisements to the host or other containers, to redirect traffic to the malicious container.

## CVE-2020-6096
 An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.
