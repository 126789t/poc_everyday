## CVE-2020-25749
 The Telnet service of Rubetek cameras RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) could allow an remote attacker to take full control of the device with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability exists because a system account has a default and static password. The Telnet service cannot be disabled and this password cannot be changed via standard functionality.

## CVE-2020-25748
 A Cleartext Transmission issue was discovered on Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339). Someone in the middle can intercept and modify the video data from the camera, which is transmitted in an unencrypted form. One can also modify responses from NTP and RTSP servers and force the camera to use the changed values.

## CVE-2020-25747
 The Telnet service of Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) can allow a remote attacker to gain access to RTSP and ONFIV services without authentication. Thus, the attacker can watch live streams from the camera, rotate the camera, change some settings (brightness, clarity, time), restart the camera, or reset it to factory settings.

## CVE-2020-25749
 The Telnet service of Rubetek cameras RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) could allow an remote attacker to take full control of the device with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability exists because a system account has a default and static password. The Telnet service cannot be disabled and this password cannot be changed via standard functionality.

## CVE-2020-25748
 A Cleartext Transmission issue was discovered on Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339). Someone in the middle can intercept and modify the video data from the camera, which is transmitted in an unencrypted form. One can also modify responses from NTP and RTSP servers and force the camera to use the changed values.

## CVE-2020-25749
 The Telnet service of Rubetek cameras RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) could allow an remote attacker to take full control of the device with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability exists because a system account has a default and static password. The Telnet service cannot be disabled and this password cannot be changed via standard functionality.

## CVE-2020-25748
 A Cleartext Transmission issue was discovered on Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339). Someone in the middle can intercept and modify the video data from the camera, which is transmitted in an unencrypted form. One can also modify responses from NTP and RTSP servers and force the camera to use the changed values.

## CVE-2020-25747
 The Telnet service of Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) can allow a remote attacker to gain access to RTSP and ONFIV services without authentication. Thus, the attacker can watch live streams from the camera, rotate the camera, change some settings (brightness, clarity, time), restart the camera, or reset it to factory settings.

 The Telnet service of Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) can allow a remote attacker to gain access to RTSP and ONFIV services without authentication. Thus, the attacker can watch live streams from the camera, rotate the camera, change some settings (brightness, clarity, time), restart the camera, or reset it to factory settings.

## CVE-2020-25749
 The Telnet service of Rubetek cameras RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) could allow an remote attacker to take full control of the device with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability exists because a system account has a default and static password. The Telnet service cannot be disabled and this password cannot be changed via standard functionality.

## CVE-2020-25748
 A Cleartext Transmission issue was discovered on Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339). Someone in the middle can intercept and modify the video data from the camera, which is transmitted in an unencrypted form. One can also modify responses from NTP and RTSP servers and force the camera to use the changed values.

## CVE-2020-25749
 The Telnet service of Rubetek cameras RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) could allow an remote attacker to take full control of the device with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability exists because a system account has a default and static password. The Telnet service cannot be disabled and this password cannot be changed via standard functionality.

## CVE-2020-25748
 A Cleartext Transmission issue was discovered on Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339). Someone in the middle can intercept and modify the video data from the camera, which is transmitted in an unencrypted form. One can also modify responses from NTP and RTSP servers and force the camera to use the changed values.

## CVE-2020-25747
 The Telnet service of Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) can allow a remote attacker to gain access to RTSP and ONFIV services without authentication. Thus, the attacker can watch live streams from the camera, rotate the camera, change some settings (brightness, clarity, time), restart the camera, or reset it to factory settings.

## CVE-2020-25747
 The Telnet service of Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) can allow a remote attacker to gain access to RTSP and ONFIV services without authentication. Thus, the attacker can watch live streams from the camera, rotate the camera, change some settings (brightness, clarity, time), restart the camera, or reset it to factory settings.

## CVE-2020-25749
 The Telnet service of Rubetek cameras RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) could allow an remote attacker to take full control of the device with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability exists because a system account has a default and static password. The Telnet service cannot be disabled and this password cannot be changed via standard functionality.

## CVE-2020-25748
 A Cleartext Transmission issue was discovered on Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339). Someone in the middle can intercept and modify the video data from the camera, which is transmitted in an unencrypted form. One can also modify responses from NTP and RTSP servers and force the camera to use the changed values.

## CVE-2020-25749
 The Telnet service of Rubetek cameras RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) could allow an remote attacker to take full control of the device with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability exists because a system account has a default and static password. The Telnet service cannot be disabled and this password cannot be changed via standard functionality.

## CVE-2020-25748
 A Cleartext Transmission issue was discovered on Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339). Someone in the middle can intercept and modify the video data from the camera, which is transmitted in an unencrypted form. One can also modify responses from NTP and RTSP servers and force the camera to use the changed values.

## CVE-2020-25747
 The Telnet service of Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) can allow a remote attacker to gain access to RTSP and ONFIV services without authentication. Thus, the attacker can watch live streams from the camera, rotate the camera, change some settings (brightness, clarity, time), restart the camera, or reset it to factory settings.
