## CVE-2020-36730
 The CMP for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the cmp_get_post_detail(), niteo_export_csv(), and cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax() functions in versions up to, and including, 3.8.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read posts, export subscriber lists, and/or deactivate the plugin.

## CVE-2020-10663
 The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9, 2.5 through 2.5.7, and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability. This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.

## CVE-2020-36730
 The CMP for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the cmp_get_post_detail(), niteo_export_csv(), and cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax() functions in versions up to, and including, 3.8.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read posts, export subscriber lists, and/or deactivate the plugin.

## CVE-2020-10663
 The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9, 2.5 through 2.5.7, and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability. This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.

## CVE-2020-36730
 The CMP for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the cmp_get_post_detail(), niteo_export_csv(), and cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax() functions in versions up to, and including, 3.8.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read posts, export subscriber lists, and/or deactivate the plugin.

## CVE-2020-10663
 The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9, 2.5 through 2.5.7, and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability. This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.
